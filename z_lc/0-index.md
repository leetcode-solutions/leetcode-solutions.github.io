This is a repository of solutions to various leetcode problems.

The goal of the solution writeups is to describe the process of _why_ a decision is made in approaching solving a problem, not just explaining how the code works. For similar reasons, the solution code may not be the most optimized, but should have relatively clear correspondence with what is discussed in the solution writeup.

The solutions described here are not comprehensive, they're simply the solutions I ended up going with. This isn't by any means a "master handbook of optimal solutions".
